# Projective texture mapping

This is a small ThreeJS project that contains the code for my article about
projective texture mapping that you can find here: [thezivkovic.com/articles/projective-texture-mapping](http://www.thezivkovic.com/articles/projective-texture-mapping).

### What you can do with it?

When you run the project you should see the projector projecting and image to the scene, which 
contains one sphere and one cube. 

### How to run?
```
- npm install
- npm run dev
- go to localhost:8080 in your browser
```
