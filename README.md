# Projective texture mapping

This is a small ThreeJS project that contains the code for my article about
projective texture mapping that you can find here: [thezivkovic.com/articles/projective-texture-mapping](http://www.thezivkovic.com/articles/projective-texture-mapping).

### What you can do with it?

When you run the project you should see the projector projecting and image onto the scene, which 
contains one sphere and one cube. You can
- rotate the scene using mouse click&drag
- zoom in/out the scene using mouse wheel
- rotate projector around the scene origin using buttons
- increase projection size using buttons


### How to run?
```
- npm install
- npm run dev
```

then go to localhost:3000 in your browser
